# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Link to work:**
[project](https://github.com/vturrisi/pytorch-journey)

### Day 1: Jan 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
- Created a base project to start learning pytorch
- Forward and backwardprop by 'hand' using pytorch

**Info**:
- Computed loss by hand so that pytorch can perform auto derivative

### Day 2: Jan 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
- Grads are now updating
- Needs to review update by hand

- NN learns when using loss function
- NLLLoss is just a negative in pytorch
- Use CrossEntropyLoss without softmax in the last layer
- Use NLLLoss with logsoftmax in last layer

### Day 3: Jan 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**
- Studied how pytorch uses Cpp code (torch/csrc)
- Studied on how to use python with C/Cpp
